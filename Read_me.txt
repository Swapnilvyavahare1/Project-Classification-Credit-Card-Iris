A) Credit card Fraud data
Objective:
1. To classify transaction into Fraud or not.


Methodology:
1. Handle imbalance dataset- We can't do oversampling, as this is credit card fraud dataset.
2. Algorithms used- LR, DT, RF, XGB, Isolation forest, Local outlier factor, One class SVM


Results and Conclusion:
1. Isolation forest is better than all other algorithms.

B) Iris data
